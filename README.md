# CUSTOMER-SEGMENTATION-with-RFM-analysis

RFM analysis is a marketing technique consisting of the initials of the words Recency, Frequency and Monetary which is used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns.

RFM enables customers to be divided into groups based on their purchasing habits and to develop strategies specific to these groups. Specifically, this segmentation allows marketers to target specific clusters of customers with communications that are much more relevant for their particular behavior – and thus generate much higher rates of response, plus increased loyalty and customer lifetime value.
Therefore, marketers can gain an extensive understanding of their customers by analyzing three quantifiable factors. These are:

__Recency:__ How much time has elapsed since a customer’s last activity or transaction with the brand? 

__Frequency:__ How often has a customer transacted or interacted with the brand during a particular period of time? 

__Monetary:__ This is also referred to as “monetary value,” this factor reflects how much a customer has spent with the brand during a particular period of time. 

While a brand is addressing its customers, while providing an interaction with the customer, instead of accepting all of the customers as the same, it may choose to communicate in a more focused, more efficient and more beneficial way by dividing it into sub-segments. The basis of this study is related to the problem that the resource is limited and the work to be done is too much. For example, we have 1000 customers and we want to keep them. Let's segment it so that we can take a separate approach to those that are most valuable to us, and a different approach to those that may be relatively less valuable.

Here we are going to implement RFM application to solve a business problem in Python.

__Business Problem:__

An e-commerce company wants to segment its customers and determine marketing strategies according to these segments. The company believes that marketing activities specific to customer segments that exhibit common behaviors will increase revenue.

For example, it is desired to organize different campaigns for new customers and different campaigns to retain customers, which are very profitable for the company.

Segment customers with the RFM method.
